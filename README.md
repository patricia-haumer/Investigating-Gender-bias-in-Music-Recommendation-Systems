**Investigating Gender Bias in Music Recommendation Systems**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project examines gender bias in music recommender systems using Spotify Milion Playlist and Last.fm datasets. It implements fairness evaluation and mitigation using tools like Fairlearn and AIF360.

## 📁 Structure
- `data/`: contains the datasets used or links to download them
- `notebooks/`: contains data processing, modeling, and fairness evaluation notebooks
- `requirements.txt`: packages needed to run the notebooks
- `README.md`: this file

## 📊 Datasets
- **Spotify**: [Million Playlist Dataset](https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3269288)
- **Last.fm**: Collected via publicly available sources from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshal19t/lastfm-dataset)
