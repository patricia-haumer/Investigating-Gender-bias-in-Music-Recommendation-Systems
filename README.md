**Investigating Gender Bias in Music Recommendation Systems**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project investigates the presence and mitigation of **gender bias** in music recommender systems. We explore two real-world datasets (Spotify Million Playlist Dataset and Last.fm), assess fairness in popularity-based recommendation outputs, and apply algorithmic debiasing using **AIF360** and **Fairlearn**.

### 🎯 Research Questions
- Does gender bias exist in music recommender systems?

**Sub-Research Questions:**
- How do different fairness metrics e.g. demographic parity, equal opportunity reflect imbalances?​
- How do different fairness-aware tools perform in mitigating gender bias in music recommendation systems


### 🎯 Project Goals
- Analyze the **gender distribution** in Spotify and Last.fm music data.
- Build **baseline recommenders** based on item popularity.
- Quantitatively evaluate fairness using **statistical metrics** (e.g., disparate impact).
- Apply **bias mitigation strategies** (e.g., Reweighing, Fairlearn reductions).
- Promote **fairer exposure** for underrepresented gender groups in algorithmic music curation.

## 📊 Datasets
- **Spotify**: A dataset of 1 million user-generated playlists (2010–2017) used to analyze track popularity and gender representation in music recommendations [Million Playlist Dataset](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-million-playlist-dataset-challenge)
- **Last.fm**: Collected via publicly available sources from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshal19t/lastfm-dataset)
- The datasets were enriched using the [MusicBrainz API](https://musicbrainz.org/), by retrieving the gender attributes

Some data files (due to size or licensing) may be partially included or require external download.
